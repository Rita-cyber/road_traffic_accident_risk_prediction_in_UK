# road_traffic_accident_risk_prediction_in_UK

The following goals pertain to this work:

•	Conduct a literature review to understand the existing work.
•	To identify the factors that could have an impact on machine learning, use exploratory data analysis.
•	Classify dangerous areas using spatial statistics on the secondary dataset.
•	 Using support vector machine methods, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbour, Rainforest, gradient boosting, and neural networks on a secondary dataset containing RTA characteristics These ML classifiers are employed mostly due to their distinguishing features and popularity in the literature.
•	Evaluate and compare the performance of the classification models using various widely used evaluation techniques, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score.
•	To predict new regions, the best ML classifier is used.
